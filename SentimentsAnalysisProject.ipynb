            "['tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems plasma high definition tvs and digital video recorders moving into the living room the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years time that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes with the us leading the trend programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks through cable satellite telecoms companies and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices one of the most talked about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders dvr and pvr these set top boxes like the us tivo and the uk sky system allow people to record store play pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want essentially the technology allows for much more personalised tv they are also being built in to high definition tv sets which are big business in japan and the us but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high definition programming not only can people forward wind through adverts they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules putting together their own la carte entertainment but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as brand identity and viewer loyalty to channels although the us leads in this technology at the moment it is also concern that is being raised in europe particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky what happens here today we will see in nine months to years time in the uk adam hume the bbc broadcast futurologist told the bbc news website for the likes of the bbc there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet it is more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters but brand loyalty is important for everyone we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands said tim hanlon from brand communications firm starcom mediavest the reality is that with broadband connections anybody can be the producer of content he added the challenge now is that it is hard to promote programme with so much choice what this means said stacey jolna senior vice president of tv guide tv group is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers it means that networks in us terms or channels could take leaf out of google book and be the search engine of the future instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them but it might not suit everyone the panel recognised older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands mr hanlon suggested on the other end you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already everything is possible and available to them said mr hanlon ultimately the consumer will tell the market they want of the new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces many of them are about enhancing the tv watching experience high definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd liquid crystal display tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them instead of being external boxes one such example launched at the show is humax inch lcd tv with an hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder one of the us biggest satellite tv companies directtv has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with hours of recording capability instant replay and search function the set can pause and rewind tv for up to hours and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre show keynote speech partnership with tivo called tivotogo which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want when they want ', 'worldcom boss left books alone former worldcom boss bernie ebbers who is accused of overseeing an bn bn fraud never made accounting decisions witness has told jurors david myers made the comments under questioning by defence lawyers who have been arguing that mr ebbers was not responsible for worldcom problems the phone company collapsed in and prosecutors claim that losses were hidden to protect the firm shares mr myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors on monday defence lawyer reid weingarten tried to distance his client from the allegations during cross examination he asked mr myers if he ever knew mr ebbers make an accounting decision not that am aware of mr myers replied did you ever know mr ebbers to make an accounting entry into worldcom books mr weingarten pressed no replied the witness mr myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former worldcom chief financial officer scott sullivan defence lawyers have been trying to paint mr sullivan who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial as the mastermind behind worldcom accounting house of cards mr ebbers team meanwhile are looking to portray him as an affable boss who by his own admission is more pe graduate than economist whatever his abilities mr ebbers transformed worldcom from relative unknown into bn telecoms giant and investor darling of the late worldcom problems mounted however as competition increased and the telecoms boom petered out when the firm finally collapsed shareholders lost about bn and workers lost their jobs mr ebbers trial is expected to last two months and if found guilty the former ceo faces substantial jail sentence he has firmly declared his innocence ', 'tigers wary of farrell gamble leicester say they will not be rushed into making bid for andy farrell should the great britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes we and anybody else involved in the process are still some way away from going to the next stage tigers boss john wells told bbc radio leicester at the moment there are still lot of unknowns about andy farrell not least his medical situation whoever does take him on is going to take big big gamble farrell who has had persistent knee problems had an operation on his knee five weeks ago and is expected to be out for another three months leicester and saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing farrell if he decides to move to the man game if he does move across to union wells believes he would better off playing in the backs at least initially m sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre said wells think england would prefer him to progress to position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards the jury is out on whether he can cross that divide at this club the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in ready made replacement ', 'yeading face newcastle in fa cup premiership side newcastle united face trip to ryman premier league
